							Hugh Jackman on Meditation: "If you put Buddha, Jesus Christ,
							Socrates, Shakespeare, Arjuna, Krishna at a dinner table together, I
							can't see them having an argument." Meditation is all about the
							pursuit of nothingness. It's like the ultimate rest. It's better
							than the best sleep you've ever had.
